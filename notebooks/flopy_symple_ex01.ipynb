    "# Introduction\n",

    "The purpose of this exercise is to introduce the basics of using Flopy to construct, run and visualize a MODFLOW 6 model and its outputs. It is assumed you are familiar with MODFLOW 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following:\n",
    " - creating a Simulation Object\n",
    " - creating a Model Object\n",
    " - defining time and spatial discretisation\n",
    " - adding Packages\n",
    " - writting the MODFLOW files and running the model\n",
    " - post-processing some results\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is based on a simple groundwater system composed of two aquifer layers, separated by a thin low-permeability layer. A river flows across the center of the system in a straight line (not very natural, I know, but it keeps things simple for the tutorial), from West to East (left to right). The river only intersects the upper aquifer layer. The upper layer also receives recharge from rainfall.\n",
