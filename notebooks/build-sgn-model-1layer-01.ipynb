However, the model used in the PEST/PEST++ class will be slightly diferent as it is constructed in Groundwater Vistas. The purpose of the current class is to demonstrate how to use Flopy using a real-world case and input files. \n",

This allows us to add zones of greater grid resolution, whilst retaining a layered approach. We will use the USGS software GRIDGEN to construct the model grid. GRIDGEN executables are in the \"bin\" folder. \n",
