    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise addresses how to deal with data variables for MODFLOW 6 objects in FloPy. \n",
    "FloPy handles MODFLOW 6 model data in a diffferent manner from other MODFLOW model variants. \n",
    "\n",
    "FloPy stores MODFLOW 6 model data in data objects. These data objects are accesible via simulation or model packages. \n",
    "Data can be added to a package during construction or at a later stage through package attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three (at the time of writting) types of model data objects:\n",
    " - MFDataScalar\n",
    " - MFDataArray\n",
    " - MFDataList\n",
    "\n",
    "The current exercise will focus on Array Data (MFDataArray objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Array Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Array data contains data in arrays with a dimension of 1 or larger. In FloPy these data are stored in \"MFArray\" or \"MFTransientArray\" objects. \n",
    " - MFArray objects house time-invariant arrays with one, two or three dimensions. \n",
    "    - One and two dimensional arrays do not include a layer dimension. These are used for data which applies to a single alyer or is the same for all layers. Examples include an array of values for the \"top\" of the model (only applies to layer 1) or for column/row dimensions in a DIS grid which are the same for all layers.\n",
    "    - Three dimensional arrays additionaly contian a layer dimension. These usualy pertain to arrays of data applied to the entire model domain. \n",
    " - MFTransientArrays, as the name implies, house arrays of data which can change over time. These usualy pertain to data applied to the entire model domain, such as time-varying rechage arrays in the RCHA package. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through a few examples of how to set, view and change array data."

    " - as a numpy array (see for example the assignment of \"strt\" for the IC package)\n",
    "\n",
    " The manner in which an array is assigned affects how it is written to the MODFLOW6 files and how it is stored by FloPy. The former has implications down-the-line if it relates to a parameter being adjusted during parameter estimation. The latter has implications on how the data can be accesed during model construction, should it be required.\n",

First, let's set the k33overk option to True, so that k33 represents the ratio of k33/k (i.e. the ratio of vertical to horizontal k). To do so, recall the lessons of the previous exercise on scaler data."
